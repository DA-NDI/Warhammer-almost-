Player is Class for creating player;
It includes construct method, set and get for
4 attributes:

Hull points (hp): life points of the ship. If those fall to 0, the ship is destroyed. 5
points is a good average for a mid-sized ship.
Engine power (pp): The engine power gives the ship a number of points that the
players will be able to attribute to different actions when activating a ship
depending on situations. Those will be "power points" shortened with PP.
Those points can be spent to make the ship go faster, strengthen its shields
or use its weapons. This attribution is done during the order phase which will
be detailed later. 10PP represents an average for a basic ship and will be the
most common value. The biggest vessels can go up to 15PP.
Speed : Maximum number of cells that the ship can move each turn. This specificity
can be raised with the support of PP. A scout who is faster, can move
up to 20 cells. A big ass one can only go 10.
Shield (shield): Number of damage points that a ship can endure before losing his hull
points. Worth 0 upon activation of the ship and can receive PP points.
Weapons: List of weapons that each ship owns, generally one or two, sometimes
more for the really big ships. Each weapon needs PP to function. Each PP
attributed to a weapon will allow it to raise its efficiency shooting factor for
that turn. A section will be dedicated to the weapons and their specificities.

They are:
get_hp, get_pp, get_shield, set_hp, set_pp, set_shield;
Session is started.
Class is destroyed in the end.
If you want see output of construct and destruct, set static var verbose to true.
